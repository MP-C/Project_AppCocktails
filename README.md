Checkpoint 4 at WildCodeSchool: Cocktail's App. 
Goal
In last months of trainning I learned a lot on FullStack, and in last evaluation point I most, create a personal project, witch I most develop a simple and functional App front and back-end.
My app consists in having freely access a all existents cocktails in an only one place, where everyone can also create and write their own drinks and share it.

Techs
Project desing: Figma;
Project backlog: Jira;
Front: Develop with React Native expo;
Server: Node.js, Express;
DataBase: MySQL DB, diagramme.io;
(all used ressources can be found on ressources folder)

Run
To run the App :
After clonning the Cocktails Project:
1) Execute the init.sql script to create the Database.
2) Execute the exemple_data.sql script to insert test data's.
3) Front-Side : Download the Expo Go App on your phone and execute the "Expo Start" command on your terminal.And then, the scan the QR-Code from your browser with your phone.
4) Back-Side : Execute the npm start command on your terminal. Don't forget to place you in the right folders before executing commands and to adapt the .env file with your credentials.
NOTE: The architecture of server is different then usually, and I followed a modular structure
